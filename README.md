# A2 Procedural Story Generator Using Generative Grammars  
Manmeet Sagri  301545311

## Overview

For this A2 Implementing a Rule Based System assignment, I created a procedural story generator using context free generative grammars. The system uses recursive rule expansion to generate formatted short stories. I referred to the course lectures and the Week 2 Generative Grammars Google Colab lab to understand context free grammars and recursive sentence generation, then expanded that foundation into a full structured story generator with multiple rulesets.

The generator includes two different grammar rulesets:

1. Mystery  
2. Fantasy  

Each ruleset uses the same structural framework but different vocabulary and plot events to create different narrative tones.

The stories include:

• A main character  
• A setting  
• Plot elements such as inciting incident, obstacle, twist, climax, and resolution  
• Proper formatting with Title, Beginning, Middle, and Ending sections  

Each generated story is over 100 words.

## How To Run The Project

### Google Colab 

1. Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. The output generation cells will print story examples.
4. Re run the output cells to generate new variations.
